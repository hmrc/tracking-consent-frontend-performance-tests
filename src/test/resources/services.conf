# This file is read when runLocal = false in application.conf (default is false)

# This can be used to override the 'baseUrl'

# If the service name you are searching is found, baseUrl is overridden.
# For local development convenience, host and protocol will have the following defaults:
#      protocol = http
#      port = 8080
# services {
#  tracking-consent-frontend {
#    protocol = https
#    host = tracking-consent-frontend.public.mdtp
#    port = 443
#  }
#}
